   \centerline{\bf Gau\ss's proof of Algebra 
Principal Theorem}

 {\rm I present here the famous Gau\ss's proof of
  principal Theorem}

Let $P(x)=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\dots+a_n$ be a monic polynomial
of order $n$ with complex coefficients. Then princiapl 
Theorem of algebra states, that it has at least 
one complex root.

 We suppose that roots are in some field
\footnote{}{this ambiguity can be easily removed}.
The Theorem implies  that in fact all the 
roots are complex
numbers. 


1-step If degree $n$ of polynomial is odd.
