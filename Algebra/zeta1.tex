   Let $F_p$ be a primary field of characteristic  $p$, i.e. $F_p=Z/pZ$

Consider the field $\Omega_p$--algebraically closure of the field
$F_p$, i.e. the field which possesses all the roots of all the
polynomials with coefficients over $F_p$. The simplest way to
construct this field is following.

First of all consider finite algebraic extensions  of $F_p$.


  One can show that every finite algebraic extension of the field
  $F_p$ is the field $F_{p^k}$.
  It is the field which possesses all the roots of the polynomial
             $$
             x^{p^k}-x=0
             $$
How to describe this field?  It is very convenient for these
purposes to consider so called Frobenius homomorphism:Take
arbitrary root of the polynomial above which does not belong to
$F_p$. Denote it by $\theta$.
  Consider for arbitrary element $\theta\in \Sigma(f)$ the sequence of elements:
                  $$
             \{\theta,\varphi\theta,\dots,\}
                  $$
