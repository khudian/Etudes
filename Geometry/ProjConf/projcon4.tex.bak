{\it

Differential equations for parameterised geodesics define symmetric connection. Unparameterised geodesics define
projective class of connections. We come using  to the notion of Thomas bundle when projective class of connections
on the manifold define the connection on speciall one-dimensional bundle over $M$.

Everything sure is well-known, but on the other hand well-forgotten too.

  Consider the following construction which will help us to understand the meaning of Thomas bundle

  Let $\Gamma$ be a Christoffel of connection such that $[\Gamma]=0$ in given coordinates $\{x^i\}$,
  Let $\{y\}$ be new coordinates such that in these coordinates $[\Gamma]=0$ also.
  We see that both in coordinates $x$ and $y$ the Chrsitoffels have appearance $\delta t+t\delta$.
  Hence in both coordinates geodesics are straight lines and 
             $y=y(x)$ is a projective transformation. (See the lecture 1.)
    This lead us to the 
    
    {\bf Definition} We say that the atlas $\{x^i_{(\a)}\}$ of local coordiantes provide
    the manifold $M$ with {\it projective structure} and call $M$ (with this atlas) {\it a projective manifold}
   if all transition functions $x^i_{(\a)}(x_{(\beta)})$ are projective transformations.
   
    Let$\Delta_{(\a)}$ be a local connection in a coordinates $x^i_{(\a)}$ such that $\Gamma=0$ in these coordinates.
      For an arbitrary two coordinates $x^i_{(\a)}, x^i_{(\beta)}$ On the projective manifold one can define the canonical projective connection
   




Let $M$ be a projective manifold, i.e. smooth manifold equipped with an atlas such that
all transition maps are projective transformations.

One can consider on the projective manifold the projective class of connections $[\nabla]=0$. It is well-defined due
the fact that projective transformations do not change the class. (See the previous section.)
  Let $\{x^i\}$ be an arbitrary local coordinates belonging to the projective atlas.
  Consider the bundle $\hat M$ with coordinate transformation for coordinate $x^0$
  defined by the equation
  Consider differential equations


          $$
         \Gamma^i_{km}\to  \Gamma^i_{km}+\delta^i_k\o_m+\delta^i_m\o_k
          $$














\centerline {\bf ${\cal x}2$.  \bf Thomas bundle.}


    Let $M$ be a manifold equipped with projective class of connections, i.e.
    a class $[\nabla]$ of connections is defined on it.
     (We say that two connections belong to the same class if the condition (1.1) is obeyed.)
    E.g. if $M$ is $\R^n$ then consider connection which Christoffel symbols vanish in cartesian coordinates
    The projective class of connections have Christoffel symbols
      $\G^i_{km}=\delta^i_k \o_m+\delta^i_m \o_k$ where $\o_k$ is an arbitrary covector.
      Geodesics of these connections are straight lines (in Cartesian coordinates.)



    Add a new coordinate $t$, i.e. consider expanded manifold $\hat M$ with coordinates
    $x^\mu=(t,x^i), t=x^0.$
     We come to so called  so called Thomas one-dimensional bundle $\hat M$.

     Under changing of coordinates
       $x^{i'}=x^{i'}(x^i)$ the coordinate $x^0$ changes in the following way:
                   $$
                x^{0'}=\log \left(\det\left({\p x^i\over \p x^{i'} }\right)\right)+x^0
                  $$
    {\bf Theorem.} Let $[\nabla]$ be a projective class of connections on $M$. One can assign to this class the connection
$\hat \nabla$ in $\hat M$ with the following Christoffel symbols:
  $\Pi^\mu_{\nu\rho}$  ($\mu,\nu,\rho=0,1,2,\dots,n$) are such that
                              $$
                       \Pi^i_{km}=\Gamma^i_{km}+{1\over n+1}\left(\delta^i_k\gamma_m+\delta^i_k\gamma_m \right)
                              $$
for $i=1,2,3,\dots,n$ where $\gamma_i=-\Gamma^k_{ik}$,
               $$
            \Gamma^i_{k0}=\Gamma^i_{0k}=-{\delta^i_k\over n+1}
               $$
and so on.

To understand this so called so on, let us consider in detail the special case:
