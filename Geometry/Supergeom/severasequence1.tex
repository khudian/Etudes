   Let   $\O(x^a,\theta_b,\xi^c,y_d)$ be an algebra of pseudodifferential forms
on $\Pi T^*M$ ($x^a,\theta_b$ are coordinates on $\Pi T^*M$, 
$\xi^b\approx dx^a, y$ are odd and $y_b\approx d\theta_b$ are even)

   The symplecti form is just $\w=xi^m y_m$.

   Consider the spectral sequence (Severra spectral sequence)
                     $$
               (E_r,d_r)
                     $$
where $E_0=C(\Pi(\Pi T^*M))$ is an algebra of pseudodifferential forms
  $F(x,\theta,\xi,y)$, and $d_0=d+\x^m y_m$


To calculate $E_1$, consider homotpy oeprator 
$\Delta={\p^2\over \ p y_m\p \xi^m}$ and notice that
                   $$
      (d_0\Delta+\Delta d_0) F=(N-l_\xi+l_y)F
                   $$
where $l_\xi$ and $l_y$ is an order of $\xi$ and $y$ in $F$
(more accurately one have to write down integrals.)
   Since $l_\xi\leq N$
The Right hand side has chance  to vanish only if $l_\xi=n,l_y=0$, i.e. only
                   $$
    F(x,\theta, \xi,y)=s(x,\theta)\xi^1\xi^2\dots\xi^n
                   $$ 
has chance to be not coboundary of  $d_0$. One can see that this object
is really non-trivial cocycle and its class transforms as half-density.
