 On one property of anchor



    Consider algebroid:i.e. it is given vector bundle $E\to M$,
   commutator $[[\,,\,]]$ on sections obeying Jacobi idenity,
   and the anchor map $\rho$ from the vector bundle $E\to M$ to the
    tangent bundle $TM\to M$ such that for two arbitrary sections
  $s_1,s_2$ and arbitrary function $f$ the following relation holds:
                   $$
      [[fs_1, s_2]]=f[[s_1,s_2]]-\left(\rho (s_2)f\right)s_1
                   $$
    One can show that anchor map is obeying the natural relation
            $$
    \rho[[s_1,s_2]]=[\rho s_1,\rho s_2]
            $$ 
where $[\,,\,]]$ is an ordinary commutator of vector fiels.


Examples of algebroids:

1) usual tangent bundle $TM\to M$, anchor $\rho$ is idenity map


2) Lie algebra as a fibre bundle over point. 

3) $M$---Poisson manifold. Then on  sections of
$T^*M\to M$ one has natural algeborid stricture
defined by the relation that
 $[[df,dg]]=d{f,g}$ and anchor is defined by the Poisson map
from $T^*M$ to $TM$.


4) Atihay algebroid.


We give the proof of ().

Often the property () is included in axioms.


First of all note that algebroid struture on $E\to M$
defines the $Q$-manifold structure on $\Pi E\to M$
by the follwoing formula: vector field $Q$
is equal to
        $$
    Q=c\xi\xi {\p\over \p \xi}+\xi\rho {\p\over \p x}
        $$
