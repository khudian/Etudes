   \centerline {\bf Roots of $S0(2n)$}
  Consider $so(2n,C)$. Its dimension is equal to
  $n(2n-1)$. Consider generators $M_{pq}$ ($p<q$).
(One can consider $M_{ik}=x^i\p_k-x^k\p_i$,
or $M_{ik}=E_{ik}-E_{ki}$)

   Commutation rules are:
             $$
 [M_{ik}, M_{rs}]=M_{is}\delta_{kr}-M_{rk}\d_{is}-M_{ir}\delta_{ks}-
                 M_{ks}\delta_{ir}\,
             $$
Simply speaking commutator does not vanish if one of indices of 
$M_{ik}$ is equal to one of indices of $M_{rs}$.

   We see that Cartan algebra has dimension $n$. We can take 
  algebra
                    $$
    H=\}M_{12, M_{34},\dots, M_{n-1,n}\}.
                        $$
 We see that this algebra has $n(2n-1)-n$ roots, and
$n(n-1)$ simple roots.

  Now calculate weight vectors and roots.
We have
