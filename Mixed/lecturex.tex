The title of my talk it is area of my main research during last
16 years.

 First of all I will tell you about what is it geometry
 of an odd symplectic supermanifold. At least I will try to explain the meaning of
 odd prefix "super" and of odd word "odd".
 Then I will try to explain a beautiful application of odd symplectic geometry
 to the problem of calculating of topological invariants of manifolds
  in terms of functional integral. At the end of talk I will summarize
  my contribution in odd symplectic supermanifolds.

  $m$-dimensional manifold in vicinity of arbitrary point is described by coordinates
  ${x^1,\dots,x^m}$. We add additional coordinates ${\theta_1,\dots,\theta_m}$
  where ${\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n}$ are anticommuting symbols
  ($\theta_i\theta_j=-\theta_j\theta_i$) and consider the whole set
  of coordinates $x^1,\dots,x^m,\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n$ all together.
  it is useful to consider ${\bf Z}_2$ gradation:
  $p(x)=0$ (even coordinates) and $p(\theta)=1$ (odd coordinates)

  $x^i$ are even coordinates $\theta_j$ odd ones.
  Commutation relations are following
                          $$
                          \theta_i\theta_j=-\theta_j\theta_i\,,
                          x^i\theta_j=\theta_j x^i\,,
                          x^i x^j=x^j x^i
                             $$
 The essential property of supermanifold is that the coordinate
  transformations that mix even and odd variables are available:
