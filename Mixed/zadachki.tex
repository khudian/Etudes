 You have 100 roubles.
 The bottle of bear costs 37 k.
 The empty bottle 12 k.

 You buy on all money bear drink it,
 then return bottles, buy again and so on...

 How much bottles of bear you will drink?

 ***************************
 Two sequences of real numbers $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$
  obey to conditions:
                       $$
                       \cases
                         {
                         y_n-x_n=n\cr
                         y_n\cdot x_n=n\cr
                         }
                         $$
   Calculate limit of $y_n-x_n$ when $n$ tends to $\infty$
