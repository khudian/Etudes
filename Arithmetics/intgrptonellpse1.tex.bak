\centerline  {\bf Integer points on the ellipse}

\bigskip

Consider on $\R^2$ an ellipse
             $$
   ax^2+2bxy+cy^2=1,\quad (ac-b^2>0, a>0)
   \eqno (1)
             $$
and its interior, the domain $\Delta$: $\Delta\colon\quad
ax^2+2bxy+cy^2\leq 1$.

   Assume that
                $$
       ac-b^2=1,\,\,a,c,b\in \Z,
                $$
   i.e. quadratic form  $ax^2+2bxy+cy^2$ is defined by symmetric
   matrix in $SL(2,\Z)$\footnote{$^*$}{A group $SL(2,\Z)$ is a group of $2\times 2$ matrices with integer entries.}.
\medskip

What about integer points (points with integer coordinates) in this ellipse?

{\it {\bf Fact 1} The interior of the ellipse (2) possesses $4$ points with integer coordinates (except the origin $(0,0)$ ).
All these points are on the ellipse (1).}


{\bf Remark } It is well-known that any domain $M$ of the area $1$
possesses at least two points $\r_1,\r_2$ such that vector $\r_2-\r_1$ has integer coordinates (Minkovsky lemma).

  This implies the following

{\it {\bf Fact 2} Any central-symmetric convex domain $M$ of the area $S(M)=4$ possesses at least one
point with integer coordinates except the point $(0,0)$}.

It is evident that for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$, there exists
central-symmetric convex domain $M_\varepsilon$ of the area $S(M)=4-\varepsilon$ which does not possess
 any point with integer coordinates except the point $(0,0)$.
On the other hand it follows from the {Fact 1} that the ellipse
(2) is a central-symmetric convex domain of the area
$S(\Delta)=\pi<4$ which possesses 4 integer points.

\medskip

   {\sl Proof of the Fact 1}.

  This is evident in the case if $a=b=1$ and $b=0$. Ellipse becomes circle which possesses exactly four
   integer points $(1,0)$,  $(1,1)$, $(-1,0)$ and $(1,1)$.

  Hence the Fact 1 follows from the following Proposition

\m

  {\bf Proposition}  {\it A matrix equation
                     $$
                     X^+X=B\,,
                     \eqno (3)
                     $$
          has a solution $X\in SL(2,\Z)$  if $B$ is symmetric matrix in
          $SL(2,\Z)$.}



\m

Indeed let $X=\pmatrix {\a &\beta\cr \gamma &\delta}$, ($\a,
\beta\,\gamma, \delta\in \Z$) be a solution of the equation (3)
where $B$ is a matrix of quadratic form $ax^2+2bxy+cy^2$, which
defines an ellipse (1): $B=\pmatrix {a &b\cr b&c}$. Then linear
transformation
             $$
         \pmatrix {x\cr y\cr}\rightarrow  \pmatrix {\a &\beta\cr \gamma &\delta}\pmatrix {x\cr y\cr}=
         \pmatrix {\alpha x+\beta y\cr \gamma x+\delta y\cr}
         \eqno (4)
             $$
transforms circle $x^2+y^2=1$ onto the ellipse (1). This linear
transformation  establishes one-one map of lattice of points with
integer coordinates onto itself, since $\det X=1$. Points with
integer coordinates on the ellipse (1) are images of the points
  $(1,0)$,  $(1,1)$, $(-1,0)$ and $(1,1)$. They are 4 points
  $(\alpha,\gamma)$, $(\beta,\delta)$,  $(-\alpha,-\gamma)$ and $(\beta,\delta)$.

  It remains to prove the Proposition.

  {\it Proof}    The proof  is similar to the proof of the fact that the generators of the group
  $PSL(2,\bf Z)$ are matrices:
  Consider matrices
                $$
              S=\pmatrix {0 & 1\cr -1 &0},\,\,\, T=\pmatrix {1 &1\cr -1 &0}
                $$
 in $SL(2,\Z)$. One can see that $S^2=1, T^3=1$.


   Analyze the action of matrices $T$ and $S$ on the quadratic form $ax^2+2bxy+cy^2$:
                             $$
B=\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}\to S^+BS=\pmatrix {0 & -1\cr 1 &0}\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}\pmatrix {0 & 1\cr -1 &0}=
                  \pmatrix {c &-b\cr -b &a}
                  \eqno (6a)
                             $$
and
                           $$
B=\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}\to T^+BT=\pmatrix {1 & -1\cr 1 &0}\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}\pmatrix {1 & 1\cr -1 &0}=
                  \pmatrix {a+c-2b &a-b\cr a -b &a}\,.
                  \eqno (6b)
                           $$
It suffices to show that under the actions of transformations (6a, 6b) a
matrix $B=\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}$ can be transformed
to unity matrix $E=\pmatrix {1 &0\cr 0 &1}$ or ???

   Consider an arbitrary $B=\pmatrix {a &b\cr b &c}$ ($a,b,c,\in \Z, ac-b^2=1$). Suppose that $b\geq 0$.
   (If $b<0$ we apply transformation (6a)).  If

   {\it Claim The application of transformation (6a) once or twice decreases a number $b$ in the case if $b>0$}

  It follows from this claim that if $b\not=0$ then applying subsequently transformations
  $S$ (which changes $b\to -b$) and $T$ or $T^2$ we decrease $b$, and eventually we come to $b=0$.
  If $b=0$, then $a=c=1$ and $B=\pmatrix {1 &0\cr 0 &1}$.

   The claim follows from the fact that under the action of $T$
                     $$
 b{\buildrel T\over \longrightarrow a-b}\to {\buildrel T\over \longrightarrow c-b}
 \eqno (7)
                     $$
If $|a-b|<b$ then claim is proved. If
